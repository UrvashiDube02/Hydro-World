**Introduction**

Blue Revolution, the Neel Kranti Mission has the vision to achieve economic prosperity of the country and the fishes and fish farmers as well as contribute towards food and nutritional security through full potential utilization of water resources for fisheries development in a sustainable manner, keeping in view the bio-security and environmental concerns. The restructured Plan Scheme on Blue Revolution - Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries has been approved at a total central outlay of Rs 3000 crore for implementation during a period of five years (2015-16 to 2019-20). It has many objectives like creating an enabling environment for integrated development of the full potential of fisheries of the country, alongwith substantially improvement in the income status of fishers and fish farmers keeping in view the sustainability, biosecurity and environmental concerns.

**OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT**
1. Improving the economic growth 
2. Improving the nutritional and food security 
3. Increase in employment 
4. Utilization of water resources 
5. Source of income to farmers 

Focusisng on a particular region, I worked upon studying the effect of blue revolution on improving the economic growth of country. 

**OBJECTIVES ON WHICH MISSION FOCUSSED**

1. IMPROVING THE ECONOMIC GROWTH : It will help in increasing the GDP of our country through increase in food production and food processing. Currently India production is around 10 million ton and the target is upto 15 million tons by 2020. 

2. IMPROVING THE NUTRITIONAL AND FOOD SECURITY : India is on 74th rank in world in food security . When we increase the production the price level of the fisheries will decrease and the poor can afford this food which will increase their nutriotional level and even of the country .

3. INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT : We know that fishery is a labour consuming sector .So when the govt provides with funds and opportunity many investors will start investing in this project and so directly the employment rate will shoot up. 

4. UTILIZATION OF WATER RESOURCES: Nowadays govt is taking initiative and increasing the number of ponds in villages and so maintaing the growth water level of the country . This will increase the inland fishing by the villagers. 

5. SOURCE OF INCOME TO FARMERS : as the govt is helping the farmers in inland fishing , there is increase in the income of farmers and even raising their standard of living . All this is possible only through the Blue Revolution . Farmers are provided with short term loan and low rate of interest which is a great help to the villagers and farmers in backward areas. 


**METHODOLGY**

The mission set on fire had made so many onjectives to fulfill. All are equally important , but I decided to work on covering the objective of IMPROVING ECONOMIC GROWTH. I basically wanted to know if it was able to gain success in the field of economy or not , so I reached to a conclusion after surfing on net based on existing reports and articles. 

**RESULTS**
 
I have the following results stating the effects which blue revolution had on improving the economy. 

1. India’s fish production has increased by 19 percent over last three years.

2. Using new technologies for increasing fish production , has been responsible for achieving double digit growth. 

3. Indian production from marine fisheries increased by 6.5 percent over year in 2016-17 and inland fishing went up by more than 20 percent.

4. In India , fisheries and aquaculture are vibrant economic activities and has been fastest growing food production system during last three decades. 

5. It has been proved to be important factor for growth in coastal areas. 

6. It has evolved as a viable commercial farming practice from traditionally backyard activity over last 3 decades and shown annual growth rate of 6-7 percent which is quite impressive. 

7. In seventies mainly shrimp was exported but due to export promotional measures in eighties frozen fish etc. was also exported. Due to intro. Of scientific farming , export of frozen value added shrimp is continuing as major foreign exchange earned. 

8. There has been increase in production of fish , export and all has increased the GDP of our country . Currently India’s production is 10 million ton and target is to increase it to 15- 20 by 2020.

**CONCLUSION**

I have concluded that Blue Revolution had a positive impact on the economy, so it was worth starting the mission and having made such objectives for the benefit of the country.
